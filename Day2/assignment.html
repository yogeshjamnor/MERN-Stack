    <q>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,</q> the founder of the Maratha Empire, was born on February 19, 1630, at Shivneri Fort, near Junnar in Maharashtra. His mother, Jijabai, was a deeply religious and strong-willed woman, and his father, Shahajiraje Bhosale, was a respected general in the Deccan. From a young age, Shivaji Maharaj was inspired by the tales of Ramayana and Mahabharata, instilling in him the values of courage and justice. Under his mother's guidance, he developed a strong sense of pride for his land and a vision of Swarajya (self-rule).

    As Shivaji Maharaj’s influence grew, the Adilshahi Sultanate of Bijapur saw him as a major threat. They sent their most ruthless general, Afzal Khan, with a massive army to crush Shivaji Maharaj. Afzal Khan was known for his brutal tactics—he had destroyed Hindu temples and killed many innocent people to provoke Shivaji Maharaj into an open battle. However, Shivaji Maharaj was a master of strategy and refused to fall into this trap.

Afzal Khan invited Shivaji Maharaj to a peace meeting at Pratapgad Fort, intending to kill him with a hidden dagger. But Shivaji Maharaj, anticipating betrayal, wore an iron armor under his clothes and carried waghnakh (tiger claws) and a concealed dagger. As soon as Afzal Khan attacked, Shivaji Maharaj swiftly struck back, tearing open his stomach with his waghnakh. His forces then launched an attack on Afzal Khan’s army, completely destroying them. This event proved that Shivaji Maharaj was not only brave but also highly intelligent in warfare.

    <p class="text">
        By the mid-1660s, the Mughal Empire, led by Aurangzeb, had become Shivaji Maharaj’s biggest enemy. Aurangzeb had vast resources and a powerful army, but Shivaji Maharaj knew that to fight him, he needed wealth. He decided to target Surat, one of the richest Mughal port cities, known for its trade and wealth.

In 1664, Shivaji Maharaj and his army raided Surat, looting immense riches. However, he made sure that innocent people were not harmed, and temples and mosques were left untouched. The raid lasted for four days, and the Marathas left with huge amounts of gold, silver, and valuable goods. This attack not only boosted the Maratha treasury but also sent a message to Aurangzeb that Shivaji Maharaj was a force to be reckoned with.

        In response to Shivaji Maharaj’s growing power, Aurangzeb sent one of his best generals, Mirza Raja Jai Singh, with a massive army. The Mughals launched several attacks on Maratha forts, leading to a tough battle. After months of fighting, Shivaji Maharaj decided to sign the Treaty of Purandar in 1665 to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

According to the treaty, Shivaji Maharaj had to surrender 23 forts to the Mughals but was allowed to keep 12 forts. Additionally, he had to visit Aurangzeb’s court in Agra, which later led to another dramatic episode in his life. The Treaty of Purandar was a temporary setback, but Shivaji Maharaj used it as an opportunity to regroup and strengthen his forces.

        Following the Treaty of Purandar, Shivaji Maharaj traveled to Aurangzeb’s court in Agra. However, instead of treating him with respect, Aurangzeb humiliated him and placed him under house arrest. Shivaji Maharaj was watched closely by Mughal guards, making it nearly impossible to escape.

However, using his intelligence, he pretended to be sick and started sending daily baskets of sweets and fruits to Brahmins and saints. The guards, seeing this routine, became careless. One day, Shivaji Maharaj hid inside a large fruit basket and escaped right under Aurangzeb’s nose. He then traveled secretly across India and returned to Maharashtra, where he resumed his fight for Swarajya. This event remains one of the most legendary escapes in Indian history.

        After years of struggle, Shivaji Maharaj was finally in a position to establish an independent Hindu kingdom. On June 6, 1674, he was officially crowned Chhatrapati at Raigad Fort. This event was highly significant because, for the first time in centuries, a Hindu king had established a self-ruled kingdom in India.

During his coronation, he adopted the title “Kshatriya Kulavantas”, emphasizing his role as a protector of Dharma. He also introduced several administrative and military reforms, strengthening the Maratha Empire. His navy, one of the first in Indian history, helped him protect the western coastline from foreign invaders.

    <p class="text">After his coronation, Shivaji Maharaj continued expanding his empire, defeating the Mughals and the Siddis of Janjira. He introduced progressive policies, naval forces, and a well-organized administration. However, after a brief illness, he passed away on April 3, 1680, at Raigad Fort. His death was a great loss, but his legacy continued through the Maratha Empire, which later became one of the most powerful forces in India.
        <q>Legacy of Shivaji Maharaj </q>
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was not just a warrior but also a visionary leader. He promoted religious tolerance, established a strong naval fleet, and introduced progressive governance that ensured justice and welfare for his people. His ideals of Swarajya, self-respect, and courage continue to inspire generations, making him one of India’s greatest historical figures. </p>
