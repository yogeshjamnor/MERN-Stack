            <h1>Taj Mahal</h1>
            <p>The Taj Mahal, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, is an iconic monument located in Agra, India. Built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, it stands as a timeless symbol of love and architectural brilliance.

                Historical Background
                Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653, taking about 22 years and involving more than 20,000 artisans. The monument was designed by the Persian architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori and reflects the finest elements of Mughal, Persian, and Indian architecture</p>
            <p>Architectural Beauty
                The Taj Mahal is built using white marble, sourced from Rajasthan. The main structure is surrounded by four minarets, symbolizing balance and symmetry. The dome, standing at 73 meters, is one of its most stunning features. The walls are adorned with intricate carvings, calligraphy, and floral designs, with verses from the Quran inscribed on the entrance.
                
                The Taj Mahal Complex
                The monument is set within a beautiful Mughal-style garden, divided into four sections with a long reflecting pool leading to the tomb. Inside the mausoleum, the cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal rest, while their actual graves lie in a lower chamber.

            <h1>Mount Kailash</h1>
            <p>Mount Kailash is one of the most revered and mystical mountains in the world. Located in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China, it stands at 6,638 meters (21,778 feet) above sea level. This snow-capped peak is considered sacred in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Bon traditions, making it a significant spiritual destination.

                Religious Significance
                Hinduism Believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, where Shiva meditates in eternal bliss. Devotees consider it the center of the universe.
                Buddhism Known as Kang Rinpoche (Precious Snow Mountain), it is associated with Chakrasamvara, a meditation deity.
                Jainism Called Ashtapada, it is the place where the first Jain Tirthankara, Rishabhadeva, attained liberation (moksha).
                Bon Religion The followers of this Tibetan religion believe that the mountain is the spiritual axis of the world.
                Kailash Mansarovar Yatra
                One of the most challenging yet spiritually rewarding pilgrimages, the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra involves circumambulating (parikrama) the mountain, a 52 km trek that takes 2-3 days at high altitudes. Nearby Lake Mansarovar, a pristine freshwater lake, is believed to cleanse sins and provide spiritual liberation.
                
                Scientific and Mystical Aspects
                No one has ever climbed Mount Kailash, as it is considered sacred. Some believe it is forbidden by divine forces.
                The four major rivers of Asia—the Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra, and Karnali (a tributary of the Ganges)—originate near Mount Kailash.
                Some claim Kailash is a pyramid-shaped energy center, possibly man-made, adding to its mystery.</p>
