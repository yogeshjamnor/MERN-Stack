<!--

Collapse can be created by using a button and div.

The button is just like the one that we use in the case of modal with data-toggle
and data-target attribute.

Instead of button, we can also use anchor tag with class same as button styling

We can use data-toggle attribute in anchor tag for toggling the component.

But for specifying the exact component, we do not need to use data-target in anchor tag.

Instead, we can use the href attribute for specifying the exact element.
