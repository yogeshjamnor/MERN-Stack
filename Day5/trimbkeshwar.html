        <p>The temple is located between three hills namely:

            Brahmagiri,
            Nilagiri and
            Kalagiri.
            The temple has three lingas (an iconic form of Shiva) representing:
            
            Shiva,
            Vishnu and
            Brahma.</p>
            <p>The temple tank is called Amritavarshini, which measured 28 m (92 ft) by 30 m (98 ft). There are three other bodies of water, namely:
                Bilvatirtha,
                Viswanantirtha and
                Mukundatirtha.
                There are images of various deities, namely,        
                Ganga,
                Jaleswara,
                Rameswara,
                Gautameswara,
                Kedarnatha,
                Rama,
                Krishna,
                Parashurama and
                Lakshmi Narayana.

        <p>As per the Shiva Purana, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of preservation) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation</p>
        <p>To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either direction. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as the second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The Jyotirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light</p>
        <p>Originally there were believed to be 64 jyotirlingas while 12 of them are considered to be very auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve jyotirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Shiva</p>

        <p>Shri Trimbakeshwar is a religious center having one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The extraordinary feature of the Jyotirlinga located here is its three faces embodying Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Due to the excessive use of water, the linga has started to erode. It is said that this erosion symbolizes the eroding nature of human society. The Lingas are covered by a jeweled crown which is placed over the Gold Mask of Trideva (Brahma Vishnu Shiva). The crown is said to be from the age of Pandavas and consists of diamonds, emeralds, and many precious stones. The original Nassak Diamond which adorned the revered linga was eventually stolen by the British and currently is placed on a sword. The crown is displayed every Monday from 4-5 pm (Shiva).</p>
        <p>All other Jyotirlingas have Shiva as the main deity. The entire black stone temple is known for its appealing architecture and sculpture and is at the foothills of a mountain called Brahmagiri. Three sources of the Godavari originate from the Brahmagiri mountain.</p>
